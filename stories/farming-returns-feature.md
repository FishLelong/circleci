Balancer provides $BAL rewards for an liquidity providers (farming). Farming is only possible for tokens which are listed with prices on coingecko, and only when the pool is has public trading enabled. In the event that public trading is disabled, or the pool is composed entirely of tokens without coingecko prices, this section should not be displayed at all. Because we only have Balancer pools at the moment, this section will only apply if the pool is based on Balancer. If it is not, this section will not be displayed.

This section will be directly below the `Your Balance` section in the left hand column. It will have two columns, both with a purple background. The right column's background will be slightly lighter than the left's. In the left column, the Balancer logo (white) will sit to the left, with the phrase `Balancer Labs Liquidity Mining Program` on the right. `Balancer Labs` will be on the first line, and `Liquidity Mining Program` will be on the second. In the left column, 3 lines will display the annual returns. The first line will contain the percentage (ex. 26.5%) in large bold white text. The second line will display the words `Annualized Returns` in extra small text. The third line will display the words `$BAL Tokens` in extra small text.

The expected rewards percentage can be calulated with the following formula:
